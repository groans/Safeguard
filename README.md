# Safeguard
Safeguard is an all-new server protection tool for server administrators. Protect your server from the most common forms of threats: VPNs, proxies, spam bots, and chargebacks. 

Safeguard utilizes the IPQualityScore API, to lookup the IPs connecting to your server. IPQS then checks the IP against their database for VPN/proxy priors and fraudulent activity such as chargebacks. Safeguard also comes with a captcha GUI to prevent bots taking over your community.

### Features
* Prevent VPN connections
* Prevent proxy connections
* Prevent known fraudulent history (reduce chargebacks)
* Integrated captcha GUI to stop bots
* Fully configurable, easy to understand

### Usage
Install the plugin, and generate the configuration file. Head over to IPQualityScore and create an account, and put your API key into the configuration section. IPQS has a limit of 5,000 queries/month, which should be enough for smaller communities, and you can upgrade your plan to receive more monthly queries.
